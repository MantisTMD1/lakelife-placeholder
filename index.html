        <h4>Chiropractic & Kinesiology</h4>
        <p>
            When assessing one’s health, spinal balance is critical to optimal
            wellness. A spine that is aligned will allow the nervous system to send
            proper signals to our organs and muscles. Muscle balance and movement is
            also critical for a healthy nervous system and body. At Lakelife, we
            blend the best of both worlds. We focus on creating a healthy nervous
            system and spinal balance through chiropractic adjustments. We reinforce
            spinal balance through muscle balance. You may be asked to do very
            specific exercises, as well as incorporating a regular exercise routine
            as part of your treatment plan. Doing this will help you achieve lasting
            change and increased quality of life.

            Functional Medicine is looking at the root cause of disease, and

        <h4>Acupuncture</h4>
        <p>
            Acupuncture is a safe and effective way to reduce stress and pain. Very
            small needles are inserted superficially into the skin to help
            facilitate healing. There are numerous conditions that acupuncture can
            help. Dry needling and cupping can also be incorporated for certain
            musculoskeletal concerns.

        <h1>Meet Dr. Tanae Berg</h1>

        <img src = "images/headshot.jpg" id = "pro-headshot" alt="professional headshot" loading="lazy"/>


        <p>Dr. Tanae was born and raised in Rice Lake, WI. She has had a lifelong passion for health and wellness. She
            grew up going to a chiropractor who practiced Applied Kinesiology and Functional Medicine. After a life
            changing event, she decided that she wanted to help people in this way too.
        
            Dr. Tanae received her Bachelor’s of Human Biology and Doctorate of Chiropractic from Northwestern Health
            Sciences University in 2014. Wanting to further her knowledge and skills, she ventured to Texas to work
            alongside a world renowned practitioner for 6 years. She worked with Olympic and professional athletes
            including track athletes, basketball players, and boxers.
       
            With continued interest in Functional Medicine and complex cases, she became a certified Functional Medicine
            Practitioner. She also received postdoctoral training and board certification in Acupuncture.
        
            Although Dr. Tanae’s opportunity in Houston was amazing, her heart was in the Midwest, and she decided to
            move back to the Twin Cities in 2020. She joined an integrative health clinic working alongside
            chiropractors, a nurse practitioner, registered nurses, a nutritionist, and a health coach. During this time
            she got to experience a functional health care model that blended alternative and conventional medicine.
       
            In 2021, Dr. Tanae met her husband. It was at this time that she decided to create her Lakelife dream that
            was envisioned 2 years prior, and start an integrative health clinic in Wisconsin.
        
            Dr. Tanae currently helps teach Applied Kinesiology at Northwestern Health Sciences University. She loves to
            give back to her profession and help create great practitioners so more people can get well in all areas of
            life.
        
            In her free time, Dr. Tanae loves to spend time with her husband, family, and friends. You can find her
            relaxing by a lake or river, hiking, or taking in a beautiful sunset. She also loves to read, cook, and
            workout. She believes in slowing down and enjoying all seasons of life, as well as making physical,
            chemical, and emotional health a top priority for her and others that cross her path.</p>
